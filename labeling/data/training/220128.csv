Our work to reduce carbon footprint during the current reporting cycle has been highly successful.;environment
This achievement forms the foundation for our ongoing ambition to make even greater contributions to the global effort to realize the climate goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement, which is fundamental to limiting global warming.;environment
That is why, despite achieving our climate action target a year ahead of schedule, we pushed to achieve further reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in operations.;environment
target for climate action was to reduce its GHG emissions by 40 percent from a baseline.;environment
total GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) amounted to kilotons.;environment
To measure our progress, we have re-baselined our target by removing the contribution from our divested Power Grids business to the baseline.;environment
We have also excluded the emissions of the new sites added, for which no baseline data exists.;environment
Our progress to date is mainly attributable to an increased proportion of green electricity and improved methodology for monitoring emissions from our vehicle fleet.;environment

commitment to responsible business practices underpins our promise to respect and promote human rights as expressed in the International Bill of Human Rights.;human_rights
Furthermore, we are committed to implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights throughout our operations and along the value chain;human_rights
Respect for people, integrity and transparency is the basis of the behaviors we expect from every individual who works for us as a direct employee or who engages with us as a business partner or through our supply chain.;human_rights
We have also made it clear that there is no place in business or within the operations of our business partners, contractors and suppliers for modern slavery and human trafficking.;human_rights

They may get discounted funding, government supported guarantees, direct subsidies and favourable regulatory treatment.;corruption
They are also often exempted from antitrust enforcement and insolvency regulations.;corruption
they are directly linked to the governmental budget through guarantees, bailouts, foreign investments and debts.;corruption
But state-owned enterprises are often vulnerable and prone to corruption.;corruption
In addition, governmental support can result in lower production efficiency and poor economic performance.;corruption
This is because the protection they get often insulates them from competition.;corruption
Agency theory stresses that there is always a risk of managers being self-interested and using a company’s resources to enrich themselves.;corruption

Employee concerns always affect productivity, positively or negatively.;employee_concerns
Occasions when their concerns have no effect are rare and possibly non-existent.;employee_concerns
This is not a psychologically complex reality.;employee_concerns
Most managers have seen tangible effects of personal, if not professional issues affecting employee performance.;employee_concerns
Employees find new boyfriends/girlfriends, get married, receive their college or graduate degrees, or have other wonderful events occur, and their productivity tends to improve.;employee_concerns
Conversely, people face divorce, foreclosure, the loss of a parent, issues with children, or a variety of other personal issues, and their productivity declines, for at least the short term.;employee_concerns
Work-related concerns have an equal – sometimes greater – effect on employee productivity.;employee_concerns
Even the issues of just one staff member often affect the performance of a team or department, once again for better or worse.;employee_concerns
Concerns that are satisfied by management for just one team member can often uplift the performance of the whole group.;employee_concerns
On the down side, should management not address concerns of even one team member, performance of that employee – and possibly the entire team – typically suffers.;employee_concerns
The obvious conclusion: Management should address any concerns that employees have to maintain continuity of performance.;employee_concerns
Certainly, at times, the answers that management must provide are not what the employee wanted.;employee_concerns
Yet, their concerns were addressed and efforts made to resolve these issues.;employee_concerns
Management sometimes maintains that they didn’t address employee concerns because they were unaware that one or more issues existed.;employee_concerns
While this statement may be true, it is imperative that management stay aware of employee concerns so they can address them before small issues become major performance detractors.;employee_concerns
As long as your staff has the security of knowing that they will not be punished or criticized for being truthful about their concerns, they normally will be honest – sometimes brutally honest.;employee_concerns

The fastest growing areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, often face already scarce resources like land for farming.;social_concerns
As the population becomes more than the country can sustain, people will need to move elsewhere to avoid starvation and homelessness.;social_concerns
People move from one country to another, and in itself, this isn't a social problem.;social_concerns
However, immigration can place stress on government programs and social systems within a country, and it can be a divisive topic in a society.;social_concerns
These immigration-related stresses affect many people.;social_concerns
This is a divisive issue population, with some groups calling for stricter immigration laws.;social_concerns
Although the majority of citizens welcome immigrants, a 2019 poll indicates 23% of people think immigration is the most important social issue facing the country.;social_concerns
Civil rights, or the rights of citizens in a country to have equal treatment socially and politically, is another one of the most significant social issues around the world.;social_concerns
More than 40 years after passed, almost 60% still live in segregated neighborhoods and 90% report that racial discrimination is still a major problem.;social_concerns
A report from the Pew Research Center Fact Tank indicates that about 50% feel the country needs to do more to address the income gap between men and women.;social_concerns
Women still lag behind men in wages and top leadership positions held, although they are now more likely to attain a college degree.;social_concerns
Worldwide, the situation is even more extreme. UNICEF reports that 12 million girls are married before they reach adulthood, and 98 million high school-aged girls do not attend school.;social_concerns
When people are sick or hurt, they need access to medical care to get better.;social_concerns
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost one in 20 citizens do not obtain needed medical care because of the cost.;social_concerns
Worldwide, 97 million people become impoverished by seeking needed medical care, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).;social_concerns
Some types of social problems are health-based, but they also have an impact on socio-economic issues.;social_concerns
For instance, the reports that 18.5% children are considered obese, having a body mass index at or above the 95th percentile.;social_concerns
However, the childhood obesity epidemic doesn't affect all children equally.;social_concerns
Children in families where the parents have more education and higher incomes are far less likely to be obese than those in families with less education and lower incomes.;social_concerns
Obesity can also have an impact on another important social issue: bullying.;social_concerns
The PACER National Bullying Prevention Center indicates that obesity and other appearance issues are among the top reasons children report being bullied.;social_concerns
Despite recent anti-bullying initiatives, more than 20% of students report being bullied.;social_concerns
A third of those being bullied report that it happens at least once or twice each month.;social_concerns
Additionally, 24% of middle school students report they have been victims of cyberbullying, or bullying conducted online.;social_concerns
Experience teaches that government officials who oppress, abuse, and tolerate the denial of the human rights of their own people are also responsible for creating social environments that are ripe for both economic and humanitarian crises.;human_rights

Much of the ocean experienced at least one ‘strong’ Marine Heatwave at some point in 2021 – with the exception of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (due to La Niña) and much of the Southern Ocean;environment
The Laptev and Beaufort Sea in the Arctic experienced “severe” and “extreme” marine heatwaves from January to April 2021;environment
The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere and so is becoming more acidic;environment
Open ocean surface pH has declined globally over the last 40 years and is now the lowest it has been for at least 26,000 years;environment
Current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time;environment

Attribution  Preliminary “rapid attribution” studies have been carried out for the heatwave in northwest America in June and July and of floods in western Europe in July;environment
The study of the heatwave in the Pacific Northwest found that the heatwave is still rare or very rare in today’s climate, but would have been virtually impossible without climate change;environment
For the western Europe flooding, it was found that the heavy rainfall had been made more likely by climate change;environment
The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) concluded that the frequency of heatwaves in North America and the Mediterranean has increased;environment
A human contribution to these increases was found with medium confidence in North America and high confidence in the Mediterranean region;environment
The IPCC reported that heavy precipitation has increased in east Asia, but there is low confidence of human influence;environment
There was high confidence of a human influence on heavy precipitation in northern Europe, but low confidence in west and central Europe;environment
Socio-economic and environmental impacts  In the last ten years, conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks have increased in frequency and intensity;environment
The compounded effects of these perils, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a rise in hunger and, consequently, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security  Following a peak in undernourishment in 2020 (768 million people), projections indicated a decline in global hunger to around 710 million in 2021 (9%);environment
However, as of October 2021, the numbers in many countries were already higher than in 2020  This striking increase (19%) was mostly felt among groups already suffering from food crises or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), rising from 135 million people in 2020 to 161 million by September 2021  Another dire consequence of these shocks was the growing number of people facing starvation and a total collapse of livelihoods (IPC/CH Phase 5), mostly in Ethiopia, South Sudan, Yemen, and Madagascar (584 000 people);environment
Extreme weather during the 2020/2021 La Niña altered rainfall seasons contributing to disruptions to livelihoods and agricultural campaigns across the world;environment
Extreme weather events during the 2021 rainfall season have compounded existing shocks;environment
Consecutive droughts across large parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America have coincided with severe storms, cyclones and hurricanes, significantly affecting livelihoods and the ability to recover from recurrent weather shocks;environment
Extreme weather events and conditions, often exacerbated by climate change, have had major and diverse impacts on population displacement and on the vulnerability of people already displaced throughout the year;environment
droughts, flooding and other extreme weather events are hitting those least equipped to recover and adapt  Ecosystems – including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems – and the services they provide, are affected by the changing climate;environment

OUR STRONGEST TR ADING YEAR ON RECORD;irrelevant
In commodity markets characterised by upheaval, over-supply and volatile trading conditions, Trafigura Group delivered a very strong commercial and financial performance in the year to 30 September 2015.;irrelevant
The last day of fiscal year, 30 September 2015, was marked by the sad news of the passing of our Group’s Founder and Executive Chairman.;irrelevant
He remains greatly missed by all who knew him and worked with him.;irrelevant
The company’s performance during 2015, however, is strong testimony to what created over the last 22 years: a successful, fast-growing and highly profitable company built on excellent customer service and resilience through the economic cycle.;irrelevant
We grew volumes in both our core trading divisions, Oil and Petroleum Products and Metals and Minerals, recorded gross margins well above the industry average, and generated the strongest EBITDA in our company’s history.;irrelevant
Aftertaking account of investment gains, foreign exchange translation costs and write-downs, our net profit was USD1,103 million, compared to USD1,036 million in 2014.;irrelevant
During the year we developed existing customer relationships and established important new strategic partnerships, notably a new joint venture with the Abu Dhabi-based investment and development company Mubadala, to invest in base metals mining projects.;irrelevant
We also continued our programme of investment in logistical and infrastructure assets that support our trading business, moving some of the most important projects from the construction phase to the start of commercial operations.;irrelevant
At the year-end, we decided to take significant impairmentsto the value of a number of our industrial and logistical assets to reflect the impact of adverse market conditions, notably in bulk commodities.;irrelevant
These impairments, provisions and our gain on the sale of a 50 percent stake in our MATSA mine to Mubadala, are shown in the ‘other income/expense’ line of our consolidated income statement, contribute to the total of USD198 million.;irrelevant
EBITDA, which we see as the most accurate measure of operating performance since it strips out investment gains and impairments, rose 43 percent from the previous year to USD1,861 million – an outstanding operating result.;irrelevant
CONTINUED VOLUME GROWTH IN BOTH DIVISIONS;irrelevant
"The trading environment during the year was strong for oil and petroleum product markets, thanksto an increase in volatility; to lower prices and consequent increases in demand; and, to a lesser extent, to the emergence of contango pricing structures that created economic incentives for storage.";irrelevant
These conditions created support for the oil business butthe backdropwas more challenging for metals and minerals as a result of the slowdown in Chinese economic growth.;irrelevant
Decelerating GDP growth in the world’s largest metals market, coupled with restructuring of Chinese state-owned enterprises and tightness of credit, weighed on demand, depressed prices and created a growing supply surplus in some commodities.;irrelevant
In our view, some of the negative commentary on China was overdone, particularly during the second half ofthe fiscal year.;irrelevant
Economic management by the Chinese authorities remains sound despite the market uncertainties on display during the summer, and they have carefully signalled their intent to move the economy from its previous focus on manufacturing investment and exportsto a model based more on domestic consumption and services.;irrelevant
This will take time and has inevitably resulted in a slower rate of growth, impacting especially strongly on metal and mineral markets.;irrelevant
